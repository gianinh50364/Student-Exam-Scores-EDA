# Student-Exam-Scores-EDA

### Problems and Objectives
The analysis of student exam scores is crucial for understanding the relationships between different variables and identifying trends and patterns within the dataset. By gaining insights into these relationships and patterns, we can develop predictive models that help improve student performance and academic success. However, without a comprehensive examination of the data and appropriate visualization techniques, it becomes challenging to draw meaningful conclusions and to conduct later on research.

Therefore, the objectives of this notebook are:
* To explore the relationships between different variables in the dataset
* To identify trends and patterns in the data
* To visualize the data using various plotting techniques


### Conclusion
#### 1. In terms of **Gender**:
*         Males had higher scores in math while Females had higher scores in reading and writing.

#### 2. In terms of **Ethnicity**:
*         They are not equally distributed.
*         Group E has the highest score in all 3 tests.

#### 3. In term of **Parent's education**:
*         Most of them had studied high school.
*         Master's degree had the lowest population but they perform better at the exams

#### 4. In terms of **Lunch type**:
*         Students prefer standard lunch to free/reduced lunch (almost double).
*         Students who eat standard lunch have higher scores than free/reduced lunch.
*         Lunch Type greatly impacts the exam scores.

#### 5. In terms of **Practice sport**:
*         More than 3/4 of the respondent said that they practice sport sometimes/regularly.
*         Those Who practice sports tend to have higher scores than those who don't.
*         They had a somewhat impact on the exam scores but were not significant.

#### 6. In term of **Weekly study hours**:
*         The more the students study, the higher scores they get.
*         This impact should be considered.
